## 📱 Usage Guide

### Teacher Workflow

1. **Login** with teacher credentials
2. **Manage Students**: 
   - Add individual students or import via CSV
   - Organize into teams for group activities
   - Edit student information as needed
3. **Conduct Activities**:
   - Use random picker to select (R)
   - Wrong (W): immediately deduct per-question wrong points from the called student and open quiz
   - Correct (C): mark correct; optionally End Question (E) to grade all and lock
   - End Question (E): grade correct answers by current question points; advance index
   - Shortcuts: L (lock/unlock), A (reset answers), S (reset scores)
4. **Monitor Progress**:
   - View real-time class statistics
   - Check leaderboard and student rankings
   - Review activity history and trends

### Student Workflow

1. **Login** with student credentials or select profile
2. **View Dashboard**: Check personal stats and team information
3. **Participate**: Scan QR codes to earn points and join activities
4. **Track Progress**: Locked quiz disables answers; if you were the called wrong student, you are blocked for that round.
5. Student view shows only the current question index (no points), to keep focus.

## 🧩 Troubleshooting (Windows)

### 1) "Module not found: Can't resolve '@supabase/supabase-js'"

Error example:

```
⨯ ./lib/supabaseClient.ts:3:1
Module not found: Can't resolve '@supabase/supabase-js'
```

Cause:
- Package missing or a canary version resolution glitch.

Fix (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm uninstall @supabase/supabase-js
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm install @supabase/supabase-js@latest --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- If it still fails, try a clean install:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item package-lock.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

### 2) "'next' is not recognized as an internal or external command"

Error example:

```
'next' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Cause:
- Dependencies not installed in the project directory.

Fix (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Ensure Node.js >= 18.

### 3) Watchpack Error (initial scan): EINVAL lstat 'C:\pagefile.sys'

Warning example:

```
Watchpack Error (initial scan): Error: EINVAL: invalid argument, lstat 'C:\\pagefile.sys'
```

Cause:
- Windows file watcher encountering system files. Typically harmless.

Workarounds (optional):

```powershell
$env:WATCHPACK_POLLING = "true"
npm run dev
```

Or simply ignore the warning if the app runs normally.

### 4) "Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead."

Info:
- Next.js automatically switches to another free port (e.g., 3001). You can proceed at the shown URL.

Free the port (optional):

```powershell
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -State Listen).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```

## 🧪 Quiz Flow, Scoring, and Shortcuts

### Realtime Quiz Flow (Supabase)
- `class_sessions.is_quiz_locked` controls whether students can submit answers.
- When a called student answers Wrong, the teacher opens the quiz to the whole class. Realtime updates push live `quiz_stats` (A/B/C/D, total).
- The called student is blocked for that open round via `class_sessions.blocked_student_id`.
- When the teacher ends the question, correct answers are graded and the quiz is locked again; the current question index advances.

### Per-question Points & Wrong Points
- Configure per-question positive points and per-question wrong points (can be negative) in Edit Points.
- Wrong points apply immediately to the initially called student when marked Wrong.
- Import/Export format for per-question points uses one line per question:
  - `positive, wrong` (comma/space/tab separated), e.g.:
```
1, 0
2, -1
3, 0
4, -2
5, 0
```

### Student-side Rules
- When locked, students cannot select answers.
- If a student was the initially called student and answered wrong, they are blocked from answering during that open round (even if unlocked).

### Environment (Supabase)
Add these to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

Database expectations:
- Table `class_sessions`: columns `is_quiz_locked boolean`, `quiz_stats jsonb`, `blocked_student_id uuid null`.
- Table `answers`: `class_session_id`, `student_id`, `selected_answer`.
- Table `students`: `score int`, `class_session_id`.
- Realtime enabled for `class_sessions` and `students` updates.

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Teacher)
- R: Random pick (skip to next pick)
- C: Mark Correct
- W: Mark Wrong & open for class
- L: Lock/Unlock quiz
- E: End Question (grade + lock)
- A: Reset Answers (clear `answers` rows for session)
- S: Reset Scores (set all students in session to 0)
